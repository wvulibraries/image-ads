# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# don't let these stupid things in the repo
.DS_STORE
.DS_Store
.vagrant

# for coverage testing
coverage/index.html
coverage/assets
coverage/.last_run.json
coverage/.resultset.json

# needed ignored for production / travis tests
